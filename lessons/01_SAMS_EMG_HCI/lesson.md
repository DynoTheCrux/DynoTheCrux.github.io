In this assignment, you will **analyze and visualize** how an EMG wristband works, based on the research paper "A generic non-invasive neuromotor interface for human-computer interaction" found here: [LINK](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09255-w). Your task is to create a structured Miro Board (or a similar tool) that breaks down the key elements of the system, its implementation, and its potential applications.


### 1. System Outline
Create a clear and structured overview of how the EMG wristband functions. Your Miro board should include:
- **Why does it work?**  
  Explain the underlying principles behind the wristbandâ€™s functionality.
- **How is the sEMG implemented?**  
  Describe how surface electromyography (sEMG) is integrated into the device.
- **How is the sEMG processed?**  
  Explain how the signals are collected, filtered, and interpreted.

### 2. Problem Definition
Analyze the motivation behind the wristband:
- Which problem does it solve?
- What is the state of the art in VR input methods?
- What are the known problems with EMG (wristbands) so far?

---

### 3. Paper Analysis
Critically evaluate the paper:
- What are the strengths of the paper?
- What are its weaknesses?

---

### 4. Applications
Think beyond the paper and explore real-world applications:
- Where do you see potential use in sports or medical applications?
- Outline one specific application in detail and explain why this wristband would be advantageous compared to other solutions.

---

### 5. Open Questions
Reflect on your reading experience:
- Which parts of the paper were unclear or difficult to understand (e.g., methods, components, processes)?
- Identify aspects that might be relevant for further lecture discussion.
